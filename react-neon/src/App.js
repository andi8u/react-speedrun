      bind(obj) - nesures that this reffers to the object passed and not where the function is executed
       Events should be bound. Generally, if you refer to a method without () after it, 
       such as onClick={this.handleClick}, you should bind that method.
       We generally recommend binding in the constructor or using the class fields syntax
